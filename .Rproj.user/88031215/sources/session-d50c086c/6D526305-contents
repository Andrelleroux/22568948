# Data {-}

The data used is on the breakdown of both financial commitments and allocations from countries towards Ukraine.

# Analysis {-}

The first figure is analysis on the percentage of GDP (by 2021 levels) that has been committed to the cause in Ukraine. This allows us to take into account the ability of the country to give and provides an estimate of intentions.

##### Figure 1: {-}
```{r, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 9}
read_Data <- Data_Read(data_root = "data/")

Map_df <- Make_Map_Data(read_Data)

map_plot <- Create_Map(Map_df)
map_plot

```
These are the key takeaways from _figure 1_:

* Turkey has committed the lowest percentage of GDP at 0.00009%.
* Estonia has committed the highest percentage at 0.036%.
* It seems that more northern countries are willing to give a higher percentage of GDP.

Next we look at the difference between what has been promised and what has been delivered. I subtract the total allocations from the total contributions and calculate the difference, as seen below.  

```{r }

table <- Create_Table(read_Data)
table

```

_Table 1_ has the following key takeaways:

* The United States and Germany have together promised $118.79 billion more than what they have delivered.
* Estonia and the United Kingdom have allocated a combined $91.31 billion more than what they committed to.
* Australia has allocated $305.82 million __more__ than they committed for. 

# Script {-}

* Turkey has committed the least while Estonia has committed the most when taking into account GDP
* Germany and the USA have fallen woefully short of their targets when it comes to sending aid to Ukraine
* The United Kingdom, Estonia and Turkey have all provided much more than they committed
* Australia has allocated more than they have committed, but are ranked 24th out of 41 in total bilateral commitments
